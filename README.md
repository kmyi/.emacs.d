===============================================================================

This repository is a personal repository for keeping my Emacs settings the same
accross multiple  machines. The  init.el is completely  garbage at  the moment,
with probable bugs here and there. Also,  I don't really remember where I found
the snippets that basically added up to this big pile of mess.

**NOTE**:  If  any  parts  of  the  code in  this  init.el  file  violate  your
copyrights, please let me  know and I will put it  down immediately. Although I
think it should be fine.

TODO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Full justification on more major-modes
* Python docstrings screwup fix
